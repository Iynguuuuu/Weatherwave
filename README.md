Technologies that I have used for this project are JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, luxon and react icons. <br/>
I fetched data from OpenWeather endpoints. <br/>
Weatherwave will be getting temperature, humidity,feels like, sunrise, sunset, hourly, and daily forecast. <br/>
We will also display the local time at the selected location. <br/>
For input, there are some quick links on top along with a text box for searching a city and also a current location-based search.

For deploy the localhost run "npm run dev"
